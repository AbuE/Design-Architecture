# Enterprise Metamodel

The Enterprise Metamodel is a high-level, overarching model that captures all aspects of an organization, not limited to IT or architecture alone. It includes a wide range of concepts, from business strategy and organizational structure to policies, processes, and technology. An enterprise metamodel provides a holistic view of how different parts of the organization relate to each other and offers a unified approach to managing and aligning enterprise-wide elements.

Key aspects of an Enterprise Metamodel:
- **Breadth:** It covers more than just IT architecture, addressing business operations, strategic goals, policies, processes, roles, and resources across the organization.
- **Alignment:** It supports alignment between business strategy and operational execution, ensuring that the organization's goals and processes are well-integrated with the IT strategy and capabilities.
- **Unified Framework:** It provides a single, organization-wide framework that allows for consistent definitions, standards, and measurements across different functions and departments.
- **Decision-Making Support:** Facilitates enterprise-wide decision-making by presenting a complete, integrated view of all organizational resources and their dependencies.

### Differences between Enterprise Metamodel and Architecture Metamodel in TOGAF
| Aspect                    | Enterprise Metamodel                          | Architecture Metamodel (TOGAF)                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                 | Organization-wide, covering all business elements, not just architecture or IT. | Primarily focused on the architecture domain (Business, Data, Application, Technology). |
| **Purpose**               | Provides a unified view across the organization for alignment and decision-making. | Provides a structure for developing, organizing, and governing architecture artifacts. |
| **Focus**                 | Holistic, including strategy, operations, processes, roles, and resources. | Architecture-specific components like building blocks, principles, domains, and artifacts. |
| **Level of Detail**       | High-level, broad focus, unifying multiple areas within the organization. | More detailed, focused on creating architecture deliverables and ensuring alignment with ADM. |
| **Customization**         | Flexible to support various business needs across the organization. | Tailored to support TOGAF architecture methods, though extensible. |

### How They Complement Each Other
The Enterprise Metamodel provides the high-level, organization-wide context within which the Architecture Metamodel operates. While the Enterprise Metamodel ensures alignment across all functions, the Architecture Metamodel ensures that the architecture aligns with enterprise needs and contributes to organizational goals. In essence, the Enterprise Metamodel sets the "why" and "what" at the organizational level, while the Architecture Metamodel provides the "how" specifically for architecture development.
