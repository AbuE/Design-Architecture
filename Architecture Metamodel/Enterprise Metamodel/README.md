# Enterprise Metamodel

The TOGAF Content Framework and Enterprise Metamodel define a formal structure
and also provide guidance for organizations that wish to implement their
architecture within an architecture tool.

The Enterprise Metamodel defines the types of entities to appear in the models that
describe the enterprise, together with the relationships between these entities. It
allows architectural concepts to be captured, stored, filtered, queried, and
represented in a way that supports consistency, completeness, and traceability.
