# Architecture Method or Architecture Development Method (ADM)

It is a central of TOGAF that provides a structured, iterative approach for creating, managing, and evolving an enterprise architecture. It defines steps, techniques, and deliverables to help architects build a comprehensive and flexible architecture that aligns with an organization’s objectives.

The ADM cycle in TOGAF includes the following phases:

1. **Preliminary Phase:** Prepare and set up the architecture project, define the architecture principles, and secure organizational support.
2. **Phase A – Architecture Vision:** Define the scope, stakeholders, and high-level vision of the architecture project.
3. **Phase B – Business Architecture:** Develop business architecture based on business strategy and requirements.
4. **Phase C – Information Systems Architecture:** Develop the data and application architecture necessary to support the business architecture.
5. **Phase D – Technology Architecture:** Define the technology architecture to support the application and data architectures.
6. **Phase E – Opportunities and Solutions:** Identify and prioritize solutions, and formulate an implementation and migration strategy.
7. **Phase F – Migration Planning:** Create a detailed plan for implementing the chosen architecture.
8. **Phase G – Implementation Governance:** Oversee the architecture implementation, ensuring it aligns with the architecture vision.
9. **Phase H – Architecture Change Management:** Manage and adapt the architecture as necessary based on evolving business needs.

The Architecture Method within TOGAF's metamodel serves as a guide to structure the development and governance of an architecture, providing repeatable processes and best practices. This method is flexible and can be tailored to meet specific organizational needs.
