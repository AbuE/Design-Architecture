# Architecture Method or Architecture Development Method (ADM)

It is a central of TOGAF that provides a structured, iterative approach for creating, managing, and evolving an enterprise architecture. It defines steps, techniques, and deliverables to help architects build a comprehensive and flexible architecture that aligns with an organization’s objectives.

The ADM cycle in TOGAF includes the following phases:

1. **Preliminary Phase:** This phase is used for developing the Enterprise Architecture Capability.
2. **Phase A – Architecture Vision:** Purpose of this phase is to identify key stakeholders, and reach agreement in the Architecture Vision document on a summary 
               of the target and the work to reach the target.
3. **Phase B – Business Architecture:** Develop the Target Business Architecture that describes how the enterprise needs to operate to achieve the business goals, 
               and respond to the strategic drivers set out in the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses the Statement of Architecture Work and stakeholder 
               concerns. Gap Analysis is done in this phase.
4. **Phase C – Information Systems Architecture:** Develop the Target Data architecture and Target Application architecture necessary to support the business 
               architecture. Gap Analysis is also done during this phase.
5. **Phase D – Technology Architecture:** Define the Target Technology architecture to support the application and data architectures, and do Gap analysis. Technical Design Documenatation happens during this phase and also Effort Estimation and Capacity planning.
6. **Phase E – Opportunities and Solutions:** Define Architecture Roadmap and Solution Building Blocks. Technical Design document can also be updated here as well.
7. **Phase F – Migration Planning:** This ADM Phase finalizes a detailed plan for moving from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture.
8. **Phase G – Implementation Governance:** Oversee the architecture implementation, ensuring it aligns with the architecture vision.
9. **Phase H – Architecture Change Management:** Manage and adapt the architecture as necessary based on evolving business needs.

The Architecture Method within TOGAF's metamodel serves as a guide to structure the development and governance of an architecture, providing repeatable processes and best practices. This method is flexible and can be tailored to meet specific organizational needs.
