# Segment Architecture

It is a mid-level architecture that provides a detailed view of a specific part of the organization, often aligned with a business unit, function, or capability area. Segment Architecture translates the high-level direction provided by the Strategic Architecture into more specific, actionable plans for individual segments, ensuring that each part of the organization has the necessary structure and resources to achieve its objectives while aligning with overall enterprise goals.

### Key Characteristics of Segment Architecture
- **Focused Scope:** Unlike Strategic Architecture, which covers the entire enterprise, Segment Architecture focuses on a specific part, or "segment," such as a business unit, department, or functional area (e.g., finance, marketing, or supply chain).
- **Medium-Term Horizon:** Segment Architecture generally has a planning horizon of 1–3 years and outlines the path for achieving segment-specific goals that are aligned with enterprise strategy.
- **Alignment with Strategic Architecture:** It acts as a bridge between Strategic Architecture and Capability Architecture (or project-level architectures), ensuring that the detailed implementations at the capability level support both the segment and broader strategic goals.

### Components of Segment Architecture
Segment Architecture often includes:
1. **Business Capabilities and Objectives:** Defines the key capabilities that the segment needs to meet its specific objectives and support enterprise goals.
2. **Detailed Requirements:** Captures requirements specific to the segment, including business, data, application, and technology requirements.
3. **Segment-Specific Principles and Standards:** Defines architecture principles and standards tailored to the segment, ensuring they align with the enterprise-wide principles but address segment-specific needs.
4. **Roadmap for Segment Initiatives:** Outlines initiatives, projects, and milestones needed within the segment to move toward the target state over the medium term.
5. **Detailed Domain Architectures:** Includes business, data, application, and technology architectures for the segment, specifying the key systems, data flows, and technology components needed to support the segment's goals.
6. **Segment-Level Views and Models:** Provides segment-specific models, diagrams, and views, such as process flows, application landscapes, or data models, to illustrate the architecture and communicate it to stakeholders.

### Purpose and Benefits of Segment Architecture
- **Operationalizing Strategic Goals:** Segment Architecture helps operationalize the Strategic Architecture by breaking down high-level goals into actionable, segment-specific initiatives.
- **Focused Alignment with Business Needs:** By addressing the specific needs of a business unit or function, Segment Architecture ensures the architecture is tailored to the unique objectives, processes, and capabilities of that segment.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Guides resource allocation within the segment, helping to prioritize projects that are aligned with both segment and enterprise-wide objectives.
- **Facilitating Change and Transformation:** Segment Architecture helps manage change within a specific area of the organization, enabling it to adapt to new requirements while maintaining alignment with the overall enterprise architecture.

### How Segment Architecture Fits into TOGAF’s ADM
In TOGAF’s **Architecture Development Method (ADM)**, Segment Architecture is typically developed across **Phase B (Business Architecture), Phase C (Data and Application Architectures), and Phase D (Technology Architecture)**. During these phases, architects create the necessary architectural components and plans to meet segment-specific needs.

Segment Architecture is built upon the direction set by the Strategic Architecture (defined in the Preliminary Phase and Phase A). It ensures that the more granular work done in Capability Architecture (project-level) adheres to both segment-specific and enterprise-wide objectives, creating a structured, layered approach to architecture development.

In essence, Segment Architecture plays a crucial role in translating strategic goals into functional, medium-term plans for specific parts of the organization, ensuring a cohesive and aligned approach to enterprise transformation.
