# Architecture Landscape

It is a framework that provides a comprehensive, layered view of the enterprise architecture across different timeframes and levels of detail. It organizes architectural work into different "landscapes" to reflect various perspectives within the organization, from a strategic long-term view to detailed project-level implementations. The Architecture Landscape allows organizations to manage complexity, ensure alignment with strategic goals, and effectively plan and govern architectural changes over time.

### Key Elements of the Architecture Landscape
The Architecture Landscape is typically divided into three levels, each with a distinct scope and purpose:

1. **Strategic Architecture**
   - **Scope:** Broad, high-level view of the entire enterprise.
   - **Timeframe:** Long-term (3–5 years or more).
   - **Purpose:** Aligns enterprise architecture with long-term business goals and high-level strategies. It helps in defining an overarching roadmap that reflects the future vision of the organization.
   - **Components:** Major initiatives, future capabilities, strategic investments, and emerging technologies that support long-term objectives.

2. **Segment Architecture**
   - **Scope:** Detailed view of a specific part or "segment" of the organization, such as a business unit, department, or functional area.
   - **Timeframe:** Medium-term (1–3 years).
   - **Purpose:** Addresses more specific business needs within a segment, ensuring alignment with the overall strategic architecture. Segment architecture provides a bridge between strategic and project architectures, translating high-level objectives into operational capabilities.
   - **Components:** Segment-specific capabilities, projects, application portfolios, and data entities that support business needs in this domain.

3. **Capability Architecture (or Project Architecture)**
   - **Scope:** Narrow, detailed view focused on specific solutions or projects.
   - **Timeframe:** Short-term (up to 1 year).
   - **Purpose:** Provides a highly detailed, actionable plan for specific projects or capabilities being developed or deployed. Capability architecture is often driven by immediate business needs and defines precise requirements and standards for solution implementation.
   - **Components:** Detailed models, solution blueprints, technical specifications, and configurations necessary to implement individual solutions.

### Benefits of Using the Architecture Landscape
- **Clarity and Alignment:** Helps maintain clarity across various architecture layers, ensuring that projects align with segment goals and overall enterprise strategy.
- **Scalability and Agility:** The layered approach allows the organization to scale architecture efforts and adapt them to different business needs while preserving alignment.
- **Effective Planning and Governance:** The Architecture Landscape allows for a structured, manageable approach to planning and governing architecture across various timeframes, from long-term strategy to immediate execution.
- **Impact Analysis and Traceability:** Provides a structured way to trace the impact of changes at different levels, helping to analyze dependencies and impacts across the architecture.

### How the Architecture Landscape Fits into TOGAF
The Architecture Landscape is part of TOGAF’s **Enterprise Continuum** and works in conjunction with the **Architecture Repository** to maintain and organize architecture assets. As organizations iterate through the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM), they populate and refine each level of the landscape, creating a repository of architecture assets aligned with strategic, segment, and project goals. 

This approach supports both the **current architecture state** and the **target architecture state**, offering a clear view of where the enterprise is now, where it aims to go, and the steps required to achieve its objectives.
