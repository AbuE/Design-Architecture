# Strategic Architecture

It represents the high-level, long-term view of an organization’s architecture, aligned with its overarching business goals and strategic objectives. This level of architecture provides the big-picture perspective, setting the direction for the organization's architecture efforts and guiding how all subsequent, more detailed architectures (such as Segment and Capability Architectures) will evolve over time.

### Key Characteristics of Strategic Architecture
- **Long-Term Vision:** Strategic Architecture focuses on the long-term horizon (typically 3–5 years or more) and aims to align IT and architecture initiatives with the enterprise’s future-state vision.
- **Broad Scope:** It encompasses the entire enterprise rather than focusing on specific departments or functions. This scope allows it to address high-level capabilities, major initiatives, and the structural elements required to achieve organizational goals.
- **Guiding Framework:** Acts as a guiding framework for Segment and Capability Architectures, setting high-level standards, principles, and roadmaps that will influence detailed project-level work.

### Components of Strategic Architecture
Strategic Architecture typically includes:
1. **Architecture Vision:** A clear statement of the high-level goals and the direction in which the enterprise architecture will evolve.
2. **Strategic Principles and Standards:** Core architecture principles that guide design and implementation decisions across the organization. Examples include principles around data sharing, technology standardization, security, and interoperability.
3. **Target State and Roadmap:** The desired future-state architecture (target state) that aligns with business strategy, along with a high-level roadmap that outlines major milestones and strategic initiatives to move from the current state to the target state.
4. **Capability Models and High-Level Business Models:** Key capabilities and business functions required to support strategic goals, often represented in models that show how business objectives translate into required capabilities.
5. **Emerging Technologies and Innovation:** Strategic Architecture may also consider emerging technologies and trends that could impact the organization’s competitive advantage or operational efficiency in the long term.

### Purpose and Importance of Strategic Architecture
- **Aligning Architecture with Business Strategy:** Ensures that IT and architecture efforts are directly aligned with strategic business goals, enhancing the value of architectural investments.
- **Providing Direction and Consistency:** Sets the high-level direction for the entire architecture landscape, creating a consistent framework that Segment and Capability Architectures will follow.
- **Enabling Agility and Preparedness:** Helps the organization prepare for and adapt to market changes and new business opportunities by setting a forward-looking architecture vision.
- **Guiding Investment Decisions:** Strategic Architecture provides insights that help decision-makers prioritize and allocate resources to initiatives that are strategically valuable.

### How Strategic Architecture Fits into TOGAF’s ADM
In TOGAF’s **Architecture Development Method (ADM)**, Strategic Architecture is typically developed during the **Preliminary Phase** and **Phase A (Architecture Vision)**. It establishes the high-level vision, principles, and goals that inform the other phases of the ADM. As architects move through subsequent phases (e.g., Business, Data, Application, and Technology Architectures), they develop more detailed architectures that remain aligned with the Strategic Architecture’s vision.

By providing a clear, strategic-level framework, Strategic Architecture helps organizations ensure their architectural work supports long-term objectives and aligns with the broader enterprise context.
