# TOGAF Content Framework and Enterprise Metamodel

The TOGAF Content Framework and Enterprise Metamodel define a formal structure
and also provide guidance for organizations that wish to implement their
architecture within an architecture tool.

The Content Framework defines a categorization framework to be used to structure
the Architecture Description, the work product used to express an architecture, and
the collection of models that describe the architecture.

The Enterprise Metamodel defines the types of entities to appear in the models that
describe the enterprise, together with the relationships between these entities. It
allows architectural concepts to be captured, stored, filtered, queried, and
represented in a way that supports consistency, completeness, and traceability.
