# TOGAF Architecture Repository

The TOGAF Standard provides a structural framework for an Architecture Repository,
that allows an enterprise to distinguish between different types
of architectural assets that exist at different levels of abstraction in the organization.
This Architecture Repository is one part of the wider Enterprise Repository, which
provides the capability to link architectural assets to components of the Detailed
Design, Deployment, and Service Management Repositories.
